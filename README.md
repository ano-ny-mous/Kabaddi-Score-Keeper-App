# Kabaddi Score Keeper App

**The Kabaddi Scorekeeper App** is a simple Android application that allows users to track scores for two teams participating in a Kabaddi match. The app provides a user-friendly interface to increment scores for each team and reset the scores when needed.

## Features

- Keep track of scores for Team A and Team B.
- Increment scores by 1 point or 3 points for each team.
- Reset scores to 0 for both teams.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio (or compatible development environment) installed.
- Basic understanding of Android development and XML layouts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code ZIP file.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components: XML layout files and Java code.

### XML Layout (activity_main.xml)

The `activity_main.xml` file defines the layout of the app's user interface. It includes elements for displaying team information, scores, and buttons for score manipulation.

### Java Code (MainActivity.java)

The `MainActivity.java` file contains the Java code that defines the behavior of the app. It handles button clicks and updates the scores displayed in the UI.

## Usage
